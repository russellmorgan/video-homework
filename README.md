## More Info

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

App.js contains the main layout, styling (as SASS) as well as two files in the /components directory:

1. VideoPlayer.js -> Handles playing and time stamp
2. LikesDislikes.js -> Connects to Firebase and records likes, dislikes and total views (views = likes + dislikes)

Both components have comments to help guide through my thinking as I coded this.
